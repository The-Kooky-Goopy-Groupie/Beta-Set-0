The wild-life is living peacefully and naturally with the residents of tree, for a brief moment, showing birds and bee's frolicking together and the rest of everyone living rather harmoniously. Eventually it stops on Bee-atrice, one of the bee folk, and the game begins for a short bit as you get a message from a bee bot to head to the queens quarters. You as such go to the place on the map, and eventually meet the Queen Bee Marigold, She has been brought here to participate in a contest to become the new queen bee by a friend bug, Poley of her she immediately declines and goes back to her hive hut to rest again. As such ceremonies start up without them, but before the winner can be chosen, The sky erupts. A large space like craft appears in the sky, and proceeds to send a digital virus that infects the creatures of the Tree's who are hit by beams from it and attacked by other infected. In the attack bee-atrice and her friend home gets blasted off falling down to far off from the tree.\r</div><div>The duo wakes up at the tree base and looks up to the tree a once peaceful tree. They assess there options and deiced that they have to climb up there to see what is happening, inside the tree, and if there any way to save the hive. The two decided that bee-atrice should fly up solo due to her much better combat abilities and maneuverability, meanwhile Poley has decided to run ground control and build a miniature base at the base of the tree to support her with information and also gather fallen items from the tree. Thus kicks off into the main gameplay, broken up into three arcs, each closed by beating a boss or bosses in order to obtain more bee bots to progress through areas that require them\r</div><div>Arc 1. The Wasp - this segement involves the first climb up bit of the Tree's trunk and the introductory level to gameplay, polly hears that a bee bot is currently making noises within the wasp hive area. The wasp are a lower faction to the bee's known for there more ballistics and ruthless nature. They however atm are busy fighting with infected bee bots, and after having there leader talk with them, have the duo ask the wasp to hold off the infection, which they refuse to do so. This however prompted they're elite captain to take the bee bot for himself to try and fight off the infection, who fly up the tree a ways. This poor fella however, soon becomes infected beyond repair, and as such becomes the stage boss that has to be beaten to get the bee bot. after which the wasp solders, noticing the severity of the situation and acknowledging they could not use they're equipment properly, form a truce with bee-atrice to help stop the spread of the infection for as long as they are able, in order to save the tree.\r</div><div>Arc 2. This is now up into the branches of the tree and presents a crossroad kerosene, they're are three bee bot's that are hidden within the area according to the new information they were able to obtain by using the wasp upgraded all be it still primitive radar, polly notices a severe level of danger coming up from the upper tree area, and as such they agreed that they'll need these bot's in order to be able to stand a chance at whatever up there. Overall you get to explore the tree at your leisure here despite the time limit going to three different areas of the tree in order to beat three beast who have the bee bots. they're are people you can help out within this area to get items that can be given to boost your bee bot's power. After beating the 3 main bosses of the area, you can go up through the base of the tree in order to fight the final zone.\r</div><div>Arc 3. This bit invoves you going through the now destroyed hive at the top of the tree in order to get back up to the very top. the bee city has been turned to ruins, and as such it's soilders attack you, eventually you re-run into the queen who was infenced and have to battle them. After which then the space creature will come down from the ship and either infect marigold, and kick phase two, or be battled by the duo of them in the true ending, thus killing the scourge. the other ending has the ship leave but the true one leads to it being destroyed and dropping a space pod, with Dr. Bi-Oh inside. he shows up at the end of the extra
